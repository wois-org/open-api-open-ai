# Style Guide

## Introduction
Welcome to the style guide for our project. This document outlines the guidelines and best practices to follow when writing code and documentation. Consistent and clean code is essential for maintainability and collaboration. By adhering to these guidelines, we can ensure a high standard of quality throughout our project.

## Code Style
If any additional questions will arise try to follow 
[The Elixir Style Guide](https://github.com/christopheradams/elixir_style_guide) by [Christopher Adams](https://github.com/christopheradams)
### Indentation
Use spaces for indentation instead of tabs. Each level of indentation should consist of 2 spaces.

### Naming Conventions
We adhere to [Elixir naming conventions](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.17.1/naming-conventions.html)

### Comments
Write expressive code and try to convey your program's intention through control-flow, structure and naming.

Comments longer than a word are capitalized, and sentences use punctuation. Use one space after periods.

Limit comment lines to 100 characters.

## Documentation Style
### File Structure
- Organize files in a logical and consistent manner.
- Use meaningful names for directories and files.

### Markdown Formatting
- Use headings to structure your documentation.
- Use bullet points for lists.
- Include code snippets using code blocks.
- Add links to external resources or related documentation.

### Writing Style
- Write in a clear and concise manner.
- Use proper grammar and punctuation.
- Avoid using jargon or technical terms without explanation.
- Be consistent with your writing style throughout the code base.

## Conclusion
Following this style guide will help maintain a consistent and professional codebase. It will also make it easier for new team members to understand and contribute to the project. Remember to review and update this guide as needed to reflect any changes in coding or documentation practices.
